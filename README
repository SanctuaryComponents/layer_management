Introduction
====================================
In the automotive domain, the most HMI systems are using their own window manager implementation. 
Many applications (e.g. navigation, reversing camera) are implemented standalone and 
therefore one service is used to composite all applications to the final image on the screen. This Service
is also know as LayerManagement. 
This Component provides a common API and a proof-of-concept implementation for the Layer Management Service. 
This service should improve the existing vendor-specific layer management implementations 
which have the following features :

    * Fixed number of hardware layers
    * Hardware accelerated compositing
    * Platform dependent
    * Number of layers not extensible during runtime
    * Vendor-specific implementation
    * No standardized interface
    * Hardware dependent
    * No change during runtime possible 

The IVI Layer Management have the following enhancements :

    * Well-defined interface
    * Standardized compositing
    * Convenient and consistent access to hardware accelerated modules
    * Separation of HMI and Layer Management
    * Dynamically Extensions during runtime
    * Low integration complexity
    * Reduced dependency on hardware 

Component Overview
====================================
The IVI Layer Management consist of three subcomponents.

The LayerManagementService
===
This is the main component which controls and handles
the different layers with its content. Furthermore he
will execute the commands which are deployed by the corresponding
communicator. The content of the different layers are deployed to the
renderer.  

The LayerManagementCommunicator
===
This subcomponent will handle the LayerManagement API messages. Generally
a communicator will establish the communication between application and the
LayerManagementService. The concept behind the communicator is to abstract
the required ipc mechanism on the target platform. 

The LayerManagementRenderer
===
This subcomponent will handle the rendering of the different layers and its content on the
final used target platform. The concept behind the renderer is to abstract
the required rendering mechanism on the target platform. 

Required Platform capabilities
====================================

Platform with X11 and OpenGL ES 2.0
===

If you have choosen the X11GLESRenderer as rendering backend, then the following
Extensions have to be supported by the TargetPlatform :

X11 Extensions:

x-composite : This extension should support redirecting of egl Surfaces to x11 pixmaps too.

EGL / OpenGL ES 2.0:

EGL_IMAGE_KHR : 
The following functions should be supported by the vendor specific graphic driver
glEGLImageTargetTexture2DOES
eglCreateImageKHR
eglDestroyImageKHR
Furthermore it should be supported to create an egl image from an x11 pixmap.  

Platform with X11 and OpenGL
===

If you have choosen the GLXRenderer as rendering backend, then the following
Extensions have to be supported by the TargetPlatform :

X11 Extensions:

x-composite : This extension should support redirecting of egl Surfaces to x11 pixmaps too.

GLX / OpenGL :

GLX_TEXTURE_FROM_PIXMAP : 
The following functions should be supported by the vendor specific graphic driver
Furthermore it should be supported to create an texture from an x11 pixmap.  


Beagle board platform
===

If you have choosen the BeagleRenderer as rendering backend, than the following
kernel module must be available too :

CMEM Module is needed, it can be downloaded from

http://software-dl.ti.com/dsps/dsps_public_sw/sdo_sb/targetcontent/linuxutils/index.html

The EGL implementation on the beagle board should support the following egl config: 

EGL_SURFACE_TYPE = EGL_WINDOW_BIT | EGL_PIXMAP_BIT
EGL_RENDERABLE_TYPE = EGL_OPENGL_ES2_BIT,
EGL_RED_SIZE = 8
EGL_ALPHA_SIZE = 8 
EGL_BIND_TO_TEXTURE_RGBA = EGL_TRUE

Furthermore the application which should be rendered by the layermanagement, should initialize egl
by the following steps:
	
1. Get EGL Display
2. Initialize EGL
3. Bind API
4. Choose EGL Config
5. Allocate native pixmap Structure 
6. Allocate native pixmap space by CMEM_alloc
7. Get physical address of native pixmap using the CMEM module, and assign the address to the native pixmap structure.
8. Create egl pixmap surface using the allocated native pixmap.
9. Create egl context.
10. Make egl context with the surface as current.


How to build on different platforms
====================================

These preconditions have to be met in order to build the LayerManager component:

- CMake required (version 2.6 or higher)

Building the LayerManager breaks down to the following steps:

1. Store IVILayerManagement_0_8_0.tar.gz in local path [referred to as <package-path>]

2. Extract the file IVILayerManagement_0_8_0.tar.gz to your target source directory [referred to as <source-dir>]

   Example: tar -xf <package-path>/IVILayerManagement_0_8_0.tar.gz

3. Create a build directory, e.g. IVILayerManagement_build [referred to as <build-dir>]

   Example: mkdir IVILayerManagement_build

4. In <build-dir> Generate build system for your platform using CMake.
   This step provides some customization options to configure build options.

   Example: cd <build-dir>
            cmake <source-dir> [optional_build_options]
   
   For a full list of available build options in [optional_build_options] see "Supported Build Options"   

5. Start the build.

   Example: make

6. Install LayerManager on local system.
   Not: This steps will require root rights on most systems.

   Example: sudo make install

The LayerManager may now be started call calling "LayerManagerService".
