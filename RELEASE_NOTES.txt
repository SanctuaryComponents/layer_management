* Platformdependent Makefiles Extensions (LayerManagerPlatform/MakeIGMA500.defs , LayerManagerPlatform/MakeDesktop.defs)


Version 0.2.1
-------------
1. Minor Bugfix regarding DBUS Communicator 
   getPorpertiesOfSurface and getPropertiesOfLayer
   
2. Code Cleanup in EGLX11ExampleApplication

3. Skript GeniviDemo.sh added to run ExampleApplications out of the box 

4. LayerManagerService handling of stopping all plugins improved

5. Logging improved for several components

Version 0.2.0
-------------

This version consist of new features and several bugfixes :

1. C-API for the LayerManagement
2. API enhancements
3. Implementation of the open use case "Make a Screen Shot"
4. Example applications
5. Several bugfixes.

1. C-API for the LayerManagement

For better usage of the LayerManagement Service from application
point of view an additional C-API is implemented (see LayerManagerClient/ilmClient).
This API is deployed as shared libraries an can be linked to the application
which will controll the service. For the internal communication between the client
and the service D-BUS is used.

2. API Enhancements

To support hardware layers and to get a better interoperability with other applications
and platforms the API was extended by the following features :

* Layer, Surface and Group Ids can be applied by from the client side too.
* IlmMatrix class is now available in the LayerManagerUtils library, to support
  simple 3D / 2D transformations

3. Implementation of the open use case "make a screen shot"

The use case "make a screen shot" was still open and is now implemented
with this release. 
 
4. Example applications

Several example applications were added to demonstrate the usage and capabilities of
the service. 

* EGLX11ApplicationExample - Rotating triangle which is registered to the service.
* LayerManagementClientExample - Example for controlling the service and the rendered layers.
* LayerSceneDescriptionExample - Example for the definition of external layer and surface ids.

5. Several bugfixes

* Race condition during access/creation/deletion of data in layer list removed.
* Layer and surface compositing in GLESGraphicSystem improved
* Issue for handling of not applied surface in X11WindowSystem removed
* Stability improvements
* Improvement of the build environemt
