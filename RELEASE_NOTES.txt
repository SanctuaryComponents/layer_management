This version consist of new features and several bugfixes :

1. C-API for the LayerManagement
2. API enhancements
3. Implementation of the open use case "Make a Screen Shot"
4. Example applications
5. Several bugfixes.

1. C-API for the LayerManagement

For better usage of the LayerManagement Service from application
point of view an additional C-API is implemented (see LayerManagerClient/ilmClient).
This API is deployed as shared libraries an can be linked to the application
which will controll the service. For the internal communication between the client
and the service D-BUS is used.

2. API Enhancements

To support hardware layers and to get a better interoperability with other applications
and platforms the API was extended by the following features :

* Layer, Surface and Group Ids can be applied by from the client side too.
* IlmMatrix class is now available in the LayerManagerUtils library, to support
  simple 3D / 2D transformations

3. Implementation of the open use case "make a screen shot"

The use case "make a screen shot" was still open and is now implemented
with this release. 
 
4. Example applications

Several example applications were added to demonstrate the usage and capabilities of
the service. 

* EGLX11ApplicationExample - Rotating triangle which is registered to the service.
* LayerManagementClientExample - Example for controlling the service and the rendered layers.
* LayerSceneDescriptionExample - Example for the definition of external layer and surface ids.

5. Several bugfixes

* Race condition during access/creation/deletion of data in layer list removed.
* Layer and surface compositing in GLESGraphicSystem improved
* Issue for handling of not applied surface in X11WindowSystem removed
* Stability improvements
* Improvement of the build environemt
