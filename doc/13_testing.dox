\page implementationNotes Implementation Notes

The Layer Management service consists of platform independent
and platform dependent components. On each platform a separate
renderer and if required a separate communicator have to be
implemented. The GENIVI proof of concept implementation uses for
the communicator a d-bus interface and for the renderer an X11
renderer which is using X-Composite and X-Damage to access the
content of different applications. For the compositing itself the
glx extension GLX_EXT_Texture_from_pixmap and the blending mode
of Open GL are used.
