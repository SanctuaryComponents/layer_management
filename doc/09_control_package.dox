\subsection layerManagementServiceDescription Description

The control is responsible for loading communication and renderer packages to be used. The
control initiates the main class, which in turn contains and manages the scene with the list
of layers and their surfaces through the Scene object, and the list of logical groups.
The renderer packages are given access to these lists by the control and the communication
packages must be able to obtain information about properties requested by clients (e.g.
“SurfaceGetVisibility”).
